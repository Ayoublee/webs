# webscraping
This code is a web scraper application built using Python's tkinter library for GUI and BeautifulSoup for web scraping. The application allows the user to scrape product information from websites such as ebay, amazon, and jumia. The user inputs a keyword and selects the website to scrape from. The information retrieved from the website is displayed in the GUI window of the application. The application also has a menu bar with options such as "File," "Help," "Contact us," and "Guide." The "Help" option opens a window with help topics, and the "Contact us" option opens a window with contact information. The data retrieved from the website is saved in a list of dictionaries with keys as "description," "price," and "link."
